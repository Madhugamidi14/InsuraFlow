## 🚀 Project Overview

**InsuraFlow** is a full-fledged, industry-standard, PySpark-based data engineering pipeline that ingests, cleans, transforms, and prepares insurance data for analytics and visualization. Designed with modularity, scalability, and real-world inconsistencies in mind, this project is perfect for demonstrating end-to-end data engineering capabilities using big data tools.

---

Insurance datasets often contain inconsistencies, formatting issues, and require enrichment for meaningful insights. **InsuraFlow** handles:

- 🧹 **Data Cleaning**: Fixes formatting issues, handles missing values, validates and normalizes fields.
- 🔄 **Data Transformation**: Enriches and reshapes the cleaned data for analytical use.
- 🔗 **Pipeline Orchestration**: Modular execution using Jupyter Notebooks and Papermill.
- 📝 **Robust Logging**: Logs every operation using centralized logging with contextual labels (`[CLEANING]`, `[TRANSFORMATION]`).

## 🧼 Cleaning Highlights

- Standardizes gender, email, boolean fields
- Validates and formats date columns
- Normalizes `contact_number` to **US format** like `+1 (123) 456-7890`
- Removes `xEXT` from phone numbers (e.g. `x12345`)
- Nullifies `claim_status` if `claim_id` is missing or invalid
- Robust logging after every step

---

## 🔁 Transformations

- Categorizes policies into **Risk Levels** (`High`, `Medium`, `Low`) based on claim amounts
- Generates `full_address` using `address + zip_code`
- Drops unnecessary fields post-cleaning (e.g., `contact_number`)

---

## 📘 Configurable Parameters

All notebook paths and logs are driven by `config/config.yaml`:

```yaml
log_file: logs/pipeline.log

notebooks:
  cleaning:
    input: notebooks/cleaning/data_cleaning.ipynb
    output_template: notebooks/cleaning/data_cleaning_output_{timestamp}.ipynb
  transforming:
    input: notebooks/transforming/data_transformer.ipynb
    output_template: notebooks/transforming/data_transformer_output_{timestamp}.ipynb
```
